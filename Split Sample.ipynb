    "In machine learning, it is necessary to split sample into train and test sets in order to evaluate model performance.  In classification problems, the distribution of target variable should be similar in test and train sets.  In case of time series problems, training data should be extracted from an earlier time frame than testing data. The following example uses transaction data from a retail bank to predict customer churn.  It shows the process of using transaction data to calculate recency, frequency and monetary value features.  In addition, statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, skewness and kurtosis of the transaction records are calculated.  Lastly, it shows how to split the sample into train and test sets, with full consideration of different time frames and target variable distribution."

The overlapping customers, mostly active ones, will be split to 75% to 25% ratio (train: test).  Therefore, no customer appears both in train and test sets."
